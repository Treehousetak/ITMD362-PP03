For our website, we want to create a website for a restaurant called "Spicy Chicken". The website will feature a menu on the website, an option for ordering food from the website by either using delivery or pick-up, and have a wide array of sauces. The customer would have to enter their information and choose a payment of credit-card or cash.

The uncomfortable rein of Chic-Fil-A will be no more. Once Spicy Chicken takes over the Chicagoland Area as the #1 chicken restaurant, the world will be next.
